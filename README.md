## 🔰 Excel Project #1
# [Movies--small-dataset-for-beginners]
This project organizes and analyzes a small dataset related to blockbuster movie hits. Designed as an introductory exploration into data structure and spreadsheet manipulation, it demonstrates how even a basic dataset can reveal meaningful insights when structured properly.

# 🧰 Tools Used
- **Google Sheets**
- **Basic Excel Functions**
- **Data Sorting & Filtering**
- **Conditional Formatting**
  
# 🔍 Key Features
- Categorization by genre, and director
- Clean format for easy readability
- Summary statistics
- Filterable layout for interactive exploration

# 💡 Lessons Learned
- Importance of data cleanliness and readability
- How formatting can influence interpretation
- Foundation for future dashboards and deeper visualization

# 📌 Next Steps
This is the first project in progressoin. I'll later expand into:
- An interactive dashboard
- A SQL-based ersion for querying
- A Python script

"Continue to thrive and grow. Every journey begins with a single step."


## 🎬 movie-sql-exploration
This beginner-friendly SQL project explores a curated movie dataset using SQLite. It includes queries for:

Counting total movies
Grouping by genre and director
Filtering by year
Listing unique genres
# 📦 Files Included
movies_portfolio.sqlite – SQLite database
queries.sql – Favorite queries from DB Browser
README.md
# 🛠️ Tech Used
SQLite via DB Browser
SQL (SELECT, COUNT, DISTINCT, GROUP BY, ORDER BY)
# 🧠 Learnings
This project helped reinforce:

# How to import CSVs into SQL
Table/column naming issues and fixes
Querying techniques
# 🧁 Next Step
We're taking this data into Python soon using sqlite3, pandas, and matplotlib for analysis and visualization.



## Movie Genre Analysis with SQL & Python 🎬📊

This project demonstrates how to visualize a simple movie dataset by:
- Importing CSV data into a SQLite database
- Running SQL queries to count genre distribution
- Using Python (Pandas + Matplotlib) to visualize the results

# 🛠️ Technologies Used:
- SQLite3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Python 3.13.3
- DB Browser for SQLite

# 📊 Visual Output:
The final output is a bar chart showing the number of movies by genre from a beginner-level dataset.

# 🧠 Lessons Learned:
- Proper file path management between SQLite and Python
- Handling CSV imports (always check that *"first row contains column names"*)
- Dynamic querying and plotting in Python
- Learning the PROPER udnerstanding of name titles
