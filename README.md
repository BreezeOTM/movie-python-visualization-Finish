# 🎬 Movie SQL & Python Visualization Project

Welcome to a beginner-friendly project that explores, analyzes, and visualizes a simple movie dataset using **Google Sheets**, **SQLite**, and **Python**. This is part of an ongoing portfolio series demonstrating fundamental data wrangling, querying, and visualization skills.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project uses a curated dataset of blockbuster movie titles to demonstrate:

- Spreadsheet formatting and basic Excel functions
- SQL queries for sorting, filtering, and summarizing movie data
- Python scripts for visualizing the results using bar charts

It’s built for beginners, yet lays the foundation for more advanced dashboards and analysis tools.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Google Sheets / Excel**  
  - Sorting & filtering  
  - Conditional formatting  
  - Summary statistics  

- **SQLite (via DB Browser)**  
  - `SELECT`, `COUNT`, `DISTINCT`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`  
  - Importing CSVs  
  - Query testing with `.sqlite` databases

- **Python 3.13.3**  
  - `sqlite3`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`  
  - SQL-to-Python workflow for dynamic querying & visualization

## 📁 Files Included

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [`Movies--small-dataset-for-beginners-main.zip`](./Movies--small-dataset-for-beginners-main.zip) | Original dataset in Google Sheets/CSV format |
| [`movie-sql-exploration-main.zip`](./movie-sql-exploration-main.zip) | SQL project archive with queries and sample outputs |
| [`movies_portfolio.sqlite`](./movies_portfolio.sqlite) | SQLite version of the movie dataset |
| [`sql_to_python.py`](./sql_to_python.py) | Python script for querying and charting genre data |
| [`SQL to Python.png`](./SQL%20to%20Python.png) | Visual reference showing SQL-to-Python output |

---

## 📊 Visual Output

The final output is a bar chart that displays the **number of movies per genre**, helping demonstrate:

- Data flow from CSV → SQL → Python
- Grouping and counting genres in SQL
- Dynamic chart generation using `matplotlib`

---

## 💡 Lessons Learned

- Importance of **clean data formatting**
- Naming columns properly during CSV imports
- Managing file paths for smooth SQL-Python interaction
- How formatting affects readability & insight
- Differences between spreadsheet filtering vs. SQL querying

---

## 📌 Next Steps

This is the *first step* in a growing portfolio. Future improvements include:

- Interactive dashboards (Tableau, Streamlit, or Dash)
- More advanced SQL joins and subqueries
- Expanding the Python visualizations to include trends and comparisons

> _“Continue to thrive and grow. Every journey begins with a single step.”_
